<p>[Originally published on <a href="http://sysadvent.blogspot.com">SysAdvent Calendar</a>, 2 Dec 2013.]</p>
<p>PURPOSE: Protect and support a humanity increasingly dependent on computers by creating a Body of Knowledge for professional and effective computer systems administration.</p>
<h2 id="problem-statement">Problem Statement</h2>
<p>Humanity is increasingly dependent on computers. More and more computer systems are deployed; the number of professional sysadmins is not growing equally fast and there is a shortage.</p>
<p>Modern policy-based configuration management tools drastically change the sysadmin to computer ratio, enabling a single sysadmin to handle thousands of computers.</p>
<p>Sadly, most sysadmins in the field are not familiar with these tools, or are just starting to learn about them. Tell your coworkers about configuration management!</p>
<p>Bottom line: the computer technology explosion is such that we need <strong>more</strong> and <strong>better</strong> sysadmins to keep humanity's computer systems online and the economies flowing.</p>
<h2 id="solution">Solution</h2>
<p>Let's list what a sysadmin should know and be able to do.</p>
<p>We could then use this list to:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>Train new sysadmins, and</p></li>
<li><p>Verify knowledge and skills of existing sysadmins, and close any gaps.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Formal definition and acceptance of this list, ideally done under the auspices of professional association and with academia involved, would establish our Body of Knowledge.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-a-body-of-knowledge">What is a Body of Knowledge?</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>Body of Knowledge (BOK or BoK) is a term used to represent the complete set of concepts, terms and activities that make up a professional domain, as defined by the relevant professional association.</p>
<p>While the term body of knowledge is also used to describe the document that defines that knowledge - the body of knowledge itself is more than simply a collection of terms; a professional reading list; a library; a website or a collection of websites; a description of professional functions; or even a collection of information. It is the accepted ontology for a specific domain.</p>
<p>-- <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_of_knowledge">&quot;Body of Knowledge&quot;, <em>Wikipedia, The Free Encyclopedia</em></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>What is &quot;ontology&quot;? Wikipedia gives us this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Ontology deals with questions concerning what entities exist or can be said to exist, and how such entities can be grouped, related within a hierarchy, and subdivided according to similarities and differences.</p>
<p>-- <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ontology">&quot;Ontology&quot;, <em>Wikipedia, The Free Encyclopedia</em></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>I found a better definition in a recent paper <a href="http://cdn.intechopen.com/pdfs/33413/InTech-What_s_wrong_with_knowledge_management_and_the_emergence_of_ontology.pdf"><em>What's Wrong with Knowledge Management? And the Emergence of Ontology</em></a> by Mark Burgess.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Technically, an ontology is defined as &quot;a set of specialized concepts within a domain&quot; (from the Greek <em>logos</em> (talk about) and <em>ontos</em> (that which exists)). It is the term used for describing domain knowledge.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A BOK could serve as a foundation for a common cirriculum. A BOK should be useful to both academia and industry.</p>
<p>Clearly defining our Body of Knowledge is the next step in maturing systems administration, the next step on the journey to Profession.</p>
<h2 id="prior-work">Prior work</h2>
<p>In 1997-1999, Geoff Halprin drafted a <a href="http://www.sabok.org/sa-bok/">SA-BOK</a> delineating Key Areas of Responsibilities of a systems administrator and providing a site assessment checklist.</p>
<p>In 2000, Mark Burgess wrote <a href="http://www.wiley.com/WileyCDA/WileyTitle/productCd-0470868074.html"><em>Principles of Network and System Administration</em></a>, an introductory college text. The publisher's book description reads:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A single, comprehensive resource that responds to the high demand for specialists who can provide advice to users and handle day-to-day administration, maintenance, and support of computer systems and networks. Author approaches both network and system administration from the perspective of the principles that do not change on a day-to-day basis. Shows how to discover customer needs and then use that information to identify, interpret, and evaluate system and network requirements. New coverage includes Java services and IPv6.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Also in 2000, Rob Kolstad and the LISA community kicked off a <a href="https://www.usenix.org/legacyurl/system-administration-taxonomy-aka-book-knowledge">sysadmin taxonomy project</a>, an attempt to build an ontology of systems administration concepts. By 2002, <a href="https://www-auth.cs.wisc.edu/lists/mad-sage/2002/msg00034.shtml">progress</a> has been made but the work was not completed.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, in 2001, Addison-Wesley published Tom Limoncelli's and Christine Hogan's <a href="http://everythingsysadmin.com/aboutbook.html"><em>The Practice of System and Network Administration</em></a>, a comprehensive overview of the practical aspects of system administration.</p>
<p>In 2011, Aleksey Tsalolikhin compiled a <em>Guide to the System Administration Body of Knowledge</em>, a round-up of Normative Literature. Normative literature describes agreed upon norms or standards. Such literature is essential for standardizing and maturing systems administration. This compilation has grown into the <a href="http://sabok.org/sabok.html">SABOK Reading List</a> and the <a href="http://sabok.org">sabok.org</a> web site.</p>
<h2 id="current-efforts">Current efforts</h2>
<h3 id="sabok">SABOK</h3>
<p>Inspired by the Software Engineering Body of Knowledge (SWEBOK), we registered <a href="http://www.sabok.org">sabok.org</a> and rounded up materials:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Delineation of the boundaries of the field, its sub-fields, and fields adjacent to it</p></li>
<li><p>Description of professional functions</p></li>
<li><p>Code of ethics</p></li>
<li><p>Reading list (including literature on best practices)</p></li>
<li><p>Professional conferences</p></li>
<li><p>Academic degree programs</p></li>
<li><p>Industry certifications</p></li>
<li><p>Professional associations</p></li>
<li><p>Ontologies</p></li>
</ul>
<p>None of the above is intended in an authoritarian fashion. It is a draft we can edit and build agreement on.</p>
<p>The ontology needs the most work and is the hardest part of putting together a SABOK.</p>
<p>A large community effort is needed to create an ontology. We are working with <a href="http://www.lopsa.org">LOPSA</a> to formally establish a Professional Content Committee to move this forward as a community. We are also in communication with academia through the ops-education Google Group.</p>
<p>Making ontologies today requires knowledge of ontology tools or involvement of ontologists:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Judging both from my own personal experience and from existing research, ontologies are notoriously hard to create for a number of reasons, see Dicheva &amp; Dichev (2005); Moench et al. (2003). They typically represent domain expertise, they need to be populated with knowledge by domain experts; however, the technologies for doing so are not user-friendly and so these trained experts need other experts (trained knowledge engineers) to make the models on their behalf - experts, requiring more experts.</p>

<p>There is an alternative to designing and managing an ontology as a tree.</p>
<p>In <em><a href="http://cdn.intechopen.com/pdfs/33413/InTech-What_s_wrong_with_knowledge_management_and_the_emergence_of_ontology.pdf"><em>What's Wrong with Knowledge Management? And the Emergence of Ontology</em></a></em>, Mark Burgess describes using promise theory to let ontology emerge as a network. Everyone contributes. Each contribution is labeled with provider. Others then vote / agree / disagree or add their own perspectives. From this network, basic patterns will emerge. This approach allows handling of greater degrees of complexity than a managed tree.</p>

<p>An important related effort is <a href="http://www.opsschool.org">Ops School</a>. In June 2012, Avleen Vig et al. started Ops School to create complete curriculum materials for training Ops Engineers.</p>
