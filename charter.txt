PURPOSE: To ensure sufficient quantity of competent sysadmins
exists to support a stable civilization; to bring about
greater agreement on what makes a competent sysadmin and how
to make one, the LOPSA zeroth Working Committee on Professionalization 
will recommend to the Board a definition of what 'profession'
means in the context of Systems Administration.  This would
enable a gap analysis (where do we want to be; where are we
now; what do we need to do to get from where we are now to
where we want to be); however the gap analysis or the implementation
of the remediation plan would be outside the scope of this working 
committee.  We envision that with the success of the zeroth
working committee, subsequent working committees would advance
the purpose further, one bite at a time.

The LOPSA Board of Directors shall appoint a current LOPSA member in
good standing to be the Professionalization Committee Chair. If the
Professionalization Chair is not a current member of the LOPSA Board of
Directors, a liaison shall be appointed to the Professionalization
Committee from among the current LOPSA Board of Directors. The
Professionalization Chair shall then select other committee members from
the community at will and as needed, an an ongoing basis.

The Professionalization Committee shall conduct its work by evaluating
various definitions of 'profession', as well as standards required
by equivalent associations in other professions.  An outside expert
on professions and professionalization may be consulted. 

TIMELINE: The Professionalization Committee shall present definition
of "Profession" to the LOPSA Board of Directors no later than
June 30th, 2014. If the LOPSA Board of Directors chooses to reject
the proposed definition, immediate notice shall be given to the
Professionalization Chair following the decision, and the
Professionalization Committee shall repeat the process of drafting
and re-presenting the definition by October 31st, 2014.
If the LOPSA Board of Directors rejects the revised 
proposal, the working committee shall be disbanded.

If the LOPSA Board of Directors accepts the definition, this definition
shall be communicated to the LOPSA membership at large no later than 
December 31st, 2014, and the working Committee dismissed
with thanks. The Board may then plan a roadmap for continuing work on
the furtherance of this project, and direct that a new Committee to
continue the work is formed and so empowered, on a time schedule
acceptable to the Board.
